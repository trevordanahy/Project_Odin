#### <div align="center"> https://www.theodinproject.com/ </div>

<p>In Norse Mythology Odin frequently made personal sacrifices in the pursuit of wisdom.  Odin was well known for diseminating the wisdom he aquired.  In honor of Odin's quests the open source project above was created to help students learn web development.</p>

<p>In February of 2020 I made a sacrifice of my own.  I quit my job in pursuit of a programming career.  I choose the full stack web development path from the website.  I replaced the Ruby cirriculum with Python and added on the Node.js package to the end of my path.  More information about why I made these choices can be found in those section's readme files.In the repo you will find my code for the curriculum projects as well as notes on what I learned.
